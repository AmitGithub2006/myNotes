    <!-- What is the DOM?
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document." -->

<!-- With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page -->

<!-- Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.
DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. -->

<!-- Why called an Object Model?
Documents are modeled using objects, and the model includes not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed like tag elements with attributes in HTML. -->

<!-- Methods of Document Object:
1.write(“string”): Writes the given string on the document.
2.getElementById(): returns the element having the given id value.
3.getElementsByName(): returns all the elements having the given name value.
4.getElementsByTagName(): returns all the elements having the given tag name.
5.getElementsByClassName(): returns all the elements having the given class name. -->
